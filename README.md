# polkadon-demo

## Introduction
This is the [react-polkadon demo website](https://VadimSaveljev.github.io/polkadon-demo/) where you can generate styles and code for react-polkadon or see the button in action  

Choose your path:
* Bob the Builder -> generate code and styles to use on your website
* Alice the Donor -> see the button in action and donate to Bob

## Blob
Blob top directory is for hosting purposes, I utilise the standart CDN for GitHub jsdelivr.
It is only used when you want to generate a vanilla JS code for the button, no React necessary in this case.
If you'd like, you can selfhost the blob code, just don't forget to change the url in the vanilla JS generated code.
